# MMSR-TUD-32 Scene Change

## Steps

### Finding the perspective

For both the foreground and background images.

1. Resize
1. Hough transform to detect lines
1. Sample lines
1. Find intersections

### Align & scale foreground

The horizon of both images should be sufficiently close to each other in order to create a believable image.

### Fix white balance
